=== 1999 to 2007 ===

The constituency was created for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 1999|first election to the Assembly]], in 1999, with the name and boundaries of the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion Westminster constituency]]. It is a [[Dyfed constituencies|Dyfed constituency]], one of five constituencies covering, and entirely within, the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Dyfed]]. 

The other four Dyfed constituencies are [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]].

The region consists of the eight constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Llanelli, [[Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Meirionnydd Nant Conwy]], [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

=== From 2007 ===

Boundaries will change for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 2007|2007 Assembly election]]. Ceredigion will remain one of five Dyfed constituencies and one of eight constituencies in the Mid and West Wales region. 
However, boundaries within Dyfed will change, to realign them with local government [[ward (politics)|ward]] boundaries and to reduce disparities in the sizes of constituency electorates, and the boundaries of the region will change, to align them with the boundaries of preserved counties.

The other four Dyfed constituencies will be, again, [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region will consist of the constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]], Llanelli, [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

For Westminster purposes, the same new constituency boundaries will become effective for the [[54th United Kingdom general election|next United Kindom general election]].

==Voting==

In [[general election]]s for the National Assembly for Wales, each voter has two votes. The first vote may be used to vote for a candidate to become the Assembly Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system. The second vote may be used to vote for a regional [[closed list|closed party list]] of candidates. Additional member seats are allocated from the lists by the [[d'Hondt method]], with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation.

'''Ceredigion''' is a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. It elects one [[Assembly Member (Welsh Assembly)|Assembly Member]] by the [[first past the post]] method of election. Also, however, it is one of eight constituencies in the [[Mid and West Wales (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Mid and West Wales]] [[electoral region (Welsh Assembly)|electoral region]], which elects four [[additional member system|additional members]], in addition to eight constituency members, to produce a degree of [[proportional representation]] for the region as a whole.

== Boundaries ==

The area of the constituency is similar to that of the [[Ceredigion|county of Ceredigion]]. 

=== 1999 to 2007 ===

The constituency was created for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 1999|first election to the Assembly]], in 1999, with the name and boundaries of the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion Westminster constituency]]. It is a [[Dyfed constituencies|Dyfed constituency]], one of five constituencies covering, and entirely within, the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Dyfed]]. 

The other four Dyfed constituencies are [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consists of the eight constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Llanelli, [[Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Meirionnydd Nant Conwy]], [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

=== From 2007 ===

Boundaries will change for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 2007|2007 Assembly election]]. Ceredigion will remain one of five Dyfed constituencies and one of eight constituencies in the Mid and West Wales region. 
However, boundaries within Dyfed will change, to realign them with local government [[ward (politics)|ward]] boundaries and to reduce disparities in the sizes of constituency electorates, and the boundaries of the region will change, to align them with the boundaries of preserved counties.

The other four Dyfed constituencies will be, again, [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region will consist of the constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]], Llanelli, [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

For Westminster purposes, the same new constituency boundaries will become effective for the [[54th United Kingdom general election|next United Kingdom general election]].

=== 1999 to 2007 ===

The constituency was created for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 1999|first election to the Assembly]], in 1999, with the name and boundaries of the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion Westminster constituency]]. It is a [[Dyfed constituencies|Dyfed constituency]], one of five constituencies covering, and entirely within, the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Dyfed]].

'''Ceredigion''' is a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. It elects one [[Assembly Member (Welsh Assembly)|Assembly Member]] by the [[first past the post]] method of election. Also, however, it is one of eight constituencies in the [[Mid and West Wales (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Mid and West Wales]] [[electoral region (Welsh Assembly)|electoral region]], which elects four [[additional member system|additional members]], in addition to eight constituency members, to produce a degree of [[proportional representation]] for the region as a whole.

== Boundaries ==

The area of the constituency is similar to that of the [[Ceredigion|county of Ceredigion]]. 

=== 1999 to 2007 ===

The constituency was created for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 1999|first election to the Assembly]], in 1999, with the name and boundaries of the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion Westminster constituency]]. It is a [[Dyfed constituencies|Dyfed constituency]], one of five constituencies covering, and entirely within, the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Dyfed]]. 

The other four Dyfed constituencies are [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consisted of the eight constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Llanelli, [[Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Meirionnydd Nant Conwy]], [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

=== From 2007 ===

Boundaries changed for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 2007|2007 Assembly election]]. Ceredigion remained one of five Dyfed constituencies and one of eight constituencies in the Mid and West Wales region. 
However, boundaries within Dyfed changed, to realign them with local government [[ward (politics)|ward]] boundaries and to reduce disparities in the sizes of constituency electorates, and the boundaries of the region changed, to align them with the boundaries of preserved counties.

The other four Dyfed constituencies are, again, [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consists of the constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]], Llanelli, [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

For Westminster purposes, the same new constituency boundaries will become effective for the [[54th United Kingdom general election|next United Kingdom general election]].

==Voting==

In [[general election]]s for the National Assembly for Wales, each voter has two votes. The first vote may be used to vote for a candidate to become the Assembly Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system. The second vote may be used to vote for a regional [[closed list|closed party list]] of candidates. Additional member seats are allocated from the lists by the [[d'Hondt method]], with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation.

'''Ceredigion''' is a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. It elects one [[Assembly Member (Welsh Assembly)|Assembly Member]] by the [[first past the post]] method of election. Also, however, it is one of eight constituencies in the [[Mid and West Wales (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Mid and West Wales]] [[electoral region (Welsh Assembly)|electoral region]], which elects four [[additional member system|additional members]], in addition to eight constituency members, to produce a degree of [[proportional representation]] for the region as a whole.

== Boundaries ==

The area of the constituency is similar to that of the [[Ceredigion|county of Ceredigion]]. 

=== 1999 to 2007 ===

The constituency was created for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 1999|first election to the Assembly]], in 1999, with the name and boundaries of the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion Westminster constituency]]. It is a [[Dyfed constituencies|Dyfed constituency]], one of five constituencies covering, and entirely within, the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Dyfed]]. 

The other four Dyfed constituencies are [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consisted of the eight constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Llanelli, [[Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Meirionnydd Nant Conwy]], [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

=== From 2007 ===

Boundaries changed for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 2007|2007 Assembly election]]. Ceredigion remained one of five Dyfed constituencies and one of eight constituencies in the Mid and West Wales region. 
However, boundaries within Dyfed changed, to realign them with local government [[ward (politics)|ward]] boundaries and to reduce disparities in the sizes of constituency electorates, and the boundaries of the region changed, to align them with the boundaries of preserved counties.

The other four Dyfed constituencies are, again, [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consists of the constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]], Llanelli, [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

For Westminster purposes, the same new constituency boundaries will become effective for the [[54th United Kingdom general election|next United Kingdom general election]].

==Voting==

In [[general election]]s for the National Assembly for Wales, each voter has two votes. The first vote may be used to vote for a candidate to become the Assembly Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system. The second vote may be used to vote for a regional [[closed list|closed party list]] of candidates. Additional member seats are allocated from the lists by the [[d'Hondt method]], with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation.

The other four Dyfed constituencies are, again, [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consists of the constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]], Llanelli, [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

For Westminster purposes, the same new constituency boundaries will become effective for the [[54th United Kingdom general election|next United Kingdom general election]].

'''Ceredigion''' is a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. It elects one [[Assembly Member (Welsh Assembly)|Assembly Member]] by the [[first past the post]] method of election. Also, however, it is one of eight constituencies in the [[Mid and West Wales (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Mid and West Wales]] [[electoral region (Welsh Assembly)|electoral region]], which elects four [[additional member system|additional members]], in addition to eight constituency members, to produce a degree of [[proportional representation]] for the region as a whole.

== Boundaries ==

The area of the constituency is similar to that of the [[Ceredigion|county of Ceredigion]]. 

=== 1999 to 2007 ===

The constituency was created for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 1999|first election to the Assembly]], in 1999, with the name and boundaries of the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion Westminster constituency]]. It is a [[Dyfed constituencies|Dyfed constituency]], one of five constituencies covering, and entirely within, the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Dyfed]]. 

The other four Dyfed constituencies are [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consisted of the eight constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Llanelli, [[Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Meirionnydd Nant Conwy]], [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

=== From 2007 ===

Boundaries changed for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 2007|2007 Assembly election]]. Ceredigion remained one of five Dyfed constituencies and one of eight constituencies in the Mid and West Wales region. 
However, boundaries within Dyfed changed, to realign them with local government [[ward (politics)|ward]] boundaries and to reduce disparities in the sizes of constituency electorates, and the boundaries of the region changed, to align them with the boundaries of preserved counties.

The other four Dyfed constituencies are, again, [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consists of the constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]], Llanelli, [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

For Westminster purposes, the same new constituency boundaries will become effective for the [[54th United Kingdom general election|next United Kingdom general election]].

==Voting==

In [[general election]]s for the National Assembly for Wales, each voter has two votes. The first vote may be used to vote for a candidate to become the Assembly Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system.

Additional member seats are allocated from the lists by the [[d'Hondt method]], with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation.

'''Ceredigion''' is a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. It elects one [[Assembly Member (Welsh Assembly)|Assembly Member]] by the [[first past the post]] method of election. It is also one of eight constituencies in the [[Mid and West Wales (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Mid and West Wales]] [[electoral region (Welsh Assembly)|electoral region]], which elects four [[additional member system|additional members]], in addition to eight constituency members, to produce a degree of [[proportional representation]] for the region as a whole.

== Boundaries ==

The area of the constituency is similar to that of the [[Ceredigion|county of Ceredigion]]. 

=== 1999 to 2007 ===

The constituency was created for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 1999|first election to the Assembly]], in 1999, with the name and boundaries of the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion Westminster constituency]]. It is a [[Dyfed constituencies|Dyfed constituency]], one of five constituencies covering, and entirely within, the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Dyfed]]. 

The other four Dyfed constituencies are [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consisted of the eight constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Llanelli, [[Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Meirionnydd Nant Conwy]], [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

=== From 2007 ===

Boundaries changed for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 2007|2007 Assembly election]]. Ceredigion remained one of five Dyfed constituencies and one of eight constituencies in the Mid and West Wales region. 
However, boundaries within Dyfed changed, to realign them with local government [[ward (politics)|ward]] boundaries and to reduce disparities in the sizes of constituency electorates, and the boundaries of the region changed, to align them with the boundaries of preserved counties.

The other four Dyfed constituencies are, again, [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consists of the constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]], Llanelli, [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

For Westminster purposes, the same new constituency boundaries will become effective for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 United Kingdom general election]].

==Voting==

In [[general election]]s for the National Assembly for Wales, each voter has two votes. The first vote may be used to vote for a candidate to become the Assembly Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system. The second vote may be used to vote for a regional [[closed list|closed party list]] of candidates. Additional member seats are allocated from the lists by the [[d'Hondt method]], with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation.

However, boundaries within Dyfed changed, to realign them with local government [[ward (politics)|ward]] boundaries and to reduce disparities in the sizes of constituency electorates, and the boundaries of the region changed, to align them with the boundaries of preserved counties.

The other four Dyfed constituencies are, again, [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consists of the constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]], Llanelli, [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

For Westminster purposes, the same new constituency boundaries will become effective for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 United Kingdom general election]].

==Voting==

The first vote may be used to vote for a candidate to become the Assembly Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system.

'''Ceredigion''' is a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. It elects one [[Assembly Member (Welsh Assembly)|Assembly Member]] by the [[first past the post]] method of election. It is also one of eight constituencies in the [[Mid and West Wales (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Mid and West Wales]] [[electoral region (Welsh Assembly)|electoral region]], which elects four [[additional member system|additional members]], in addition to eight constituency members, to produce a degree of [[proportional representation]] for the region as a whole.

== Boundaries ==

The area of the constituency is similar to that of the [[Ceredigion|county of Ceredigion]]. 

=== 1999 to 2007 ===

The constituency was created for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 1999|first election to the Assembly]], in 1999, with the name and boundaries of the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion Westminster constituency]]. It is a [[Dyfed constituencies|Dyfed constituency]], one of five constituencies covering, and entirely within, the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Dyfed]]. 

The other four Dyfed constituencies are [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consisted of the eight constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Llanelli, [[Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Meirionnydd Nant Conwy]], [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

=== From 2007 ===

Boundaries changed for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 2007|2007 Assembly election]]. Ceredigion remained one of five Dyfed constituencies and one of eight constituencies in the Mid and West Wales region. 
However, boundaries within Dyfed changed, to realign them with local government [[ward (politics)|ward]] boundaries and to reduce disparities in the sizes of constituency electorates, and the boundaries of the region changed, to align them with the boundaries of preserved counties.

The other four Dyfed constituencies are, again, [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consists of the constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]], Llanelli, [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

For Westminster purposes, the same new constituency boundaries will become effective for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 United Kingdom general election]].

'''Ceredigion''' is a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. It elects one [[Assembly Member (Welsh Assembly)|Assembly Member]] by the [[first past the post]] method of election. It is also one of eight constituencies in the [[Mid and West Wales (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Mid and West Wales]] [[electoral region (Welsh Assembly)|electoral region]], which elects four [[additional member system|additional members]], in addition to eight constituency members, to produce a degree of [[proportional representation]] for the region as a whole.

== Boundaries ==

The area of the constituency is similar to that of the [[Ceredigion|county of Ceredigion]]. 

=== 1999 to 2007 ===

The constituency was created for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 1999|first election to the Assembly]], in 1999, with the name and boundaries of the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion Westminster constituency]]. It is a [[Dyfed constituencies|Dyfed constituency]], one of five constituencies covering, and entirely within, the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Dyfed]]. 

The other four Dyfed constituencies are [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consisted of the eight constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Llanelli, [[Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Meirionnydd Nant Conwy]], [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

=== From 2007 ===

Boundaries changed for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 2007|2007 Assembly election]]. Ceredigion remained one of five Dyfed constituencies and one of eight constituencies in the Mid and West Wales region. 
However, boundaries within Dyfed changed, to realign them with local government [[ward (politics)|ward]] boundaries and to reduce disparities in the sizes of constituency electorates, and the boundaries of the region changed, to align them with the boundaries of preserved counties.

The other four Dyfed constituencies are, again, [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consists of the constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]], Llanelli, [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

For Westminster purposes, the same new constituency boundaries will become effective for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 United Kingdom general election]].

==Voting==

In [[general election]]s for the National Assembly for Wales, each voter has two votes. The first vote may be used to vote for a candidate to become the Assembly Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system. The second vote may be used to vote for a regional [[closed list|closed party list]] of candidates. Additional member seats are allocated from the lists by the [[d'Hondt method]], with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation.

'''Ceredigion''' is a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. It elects one [[Assembly Member (Welsh Assembly)|Assembly Member]] by the [[first past the post]] method of election. It is also one of eight constituencies in the [[Mid and West Wales (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Mid and West Wales]] [[electoral region (Welsh Assembly)|electoral region]], which elects four [[additional member system|additional members]], in addition to eight constituency members, to produce a degree of [[proportional representation]] for the region as a whole.

== Boundaries ==

The area of the constituency is similar to that of the [[Ceredigion|county of Ceredigion]]. 

=== 1999 to 2007 ===

The constituency was created for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 1999|first election to the Assembly]], in 1999, with the name and boundaries of the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion Westminster constituency]]. It is a [[Dyfed constituencies|Dyfed constituency]], one of five constituencies covering, and entirely within, the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Dyfed]]. 

The other four Dyfed constituencies are [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consisted of the eight constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Llanelli, [[Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Meirionnydd Nant Conwy]], [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

=== From 2007 ===

Boundaries changed for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 2007|2007 Assembly election]]. Ceredigion remained one of five Dyfed constituencies and one of eight constituencies in the Mid and West Wales region. 
However, boundaries within Dyfed changed, to realign them with local government [[ward (politics)|ward]] boundaries and to reduce disparities in the sizes of constituency electorates, and the boundaries of the region changed, to align them with the boundaries of preserved counties.

The other four Dyfed constituencies are, again, [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consists of the constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]], Llanelli, [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

For Westminster purposes, the same new constituency boundaries will become effective for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 United Kingdom general election]].

==Voting==

In [[general election]]s for the National Assembly for Wales, each voter has two votes. The first vote may be used to vote for a candidate to become the Assembly Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system.

'''Ceredigion''' is a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. It elects one [[Assembly Member (Welsh Assembly)|Assembly Member]] by the [[first past the post]] method of election. It is also one of eight constituencies in the [[Mid and West Wales (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Mid and West Wales]] [[electoral region (Welsh Assembly)|electoral region]], which elects four [[additional member system|additional members]], in addition to eight constituency members, to produce a degree of [[proportional representation]] for the region as a whole.

== Boundaries ==

The area of the constituency is similar to that of the [[Ceredigion|county of Ceredigion]]. 

=== 1999 to 2007 ===

The constituency was created for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 1999|first election to the Assembly]], in 1999, with the name and boundaries of the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion Westminster constituency]]. It is a [[Dyfed constituencies|Dyfed constituency]], one of five constituencies covering, and entirely within, the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Dyfed]]. 

The other four Dyfed constituencies are [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consisted of the eight constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Llanelli, [[Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Meirionnydd Nant Conwy]], [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

=== From 2007 ===

Boundaries changed for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 2007|2007 Assembly election]]. Ceredigion remained one of five Dyfed constituencies and one of eight constituencies in the Mid and West Wales region. 
However, boundaries within Dyfed changed, to realign them with local government [[ward (politics)|ward]] boundaries and to reduce disparities in the sizes of constituency electorates, and the boundaries of the region changed, to align them with the boundaries of preserved counties.

The other four Dyfed constituencies are, again, [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consists of the constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]], Llanelli, [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

For Westminster purposes, the same new constituency boundaries will become effective for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 United Kingdom general election]].

==Voting==

In [[general election]]s for the National Assembly for Wales, each voter has two votes. The first vote may be used to vote for a candidate to become the Assembly Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system. The second vote may be used to vote for a regional [[closed list|closed party list]] of candidates. Additional member seats are allocated from the lists by the [[d'Hondt method]], with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation.

'''Ceredigion''' is a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. It elects one [[Assembly Member (Welsh Assembly)|Assembly Member]] by the [[first past the post]] method of election. It is also one of eight constituencies in the [[Mid and West Wales (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Mid and West Wales]] [[electoral region (Welsh Assembly)|electoral region]], which elects four [[additional member system|additional members]], in addition to eight constituency members, to produce a degree of [[proportional representation]] for the region as a whole.

== Boundaries ==

The area of the constituency is similar to that of the [[Ceredigion|county of Ceredigion]]. 

=== 1999 to 2007 ===

The constituency was created for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 1999|first election to the Assembly]], in 1999, with the name and boundaries of the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion Westminster constituency]]. It is a [[Dyfed constituencies|Dyfed constituency]], one of five constituencies covering, and entirely within, the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Dyfed]]. 

The other four Dyfed constituencies are [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consisted of the eight constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Llanelli, [[Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Meirionnydd Nant Conwy]], [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

=== From 2007 ===

Boundaries changed for the [[Welsh Assembly election, 2007|2007 Assembly election]]. Ceredigion remained one of five Dyfed constituencies and one of eight constituencies in the Mid and West Wales region. 
However, boundaries within Dyfed changed, to realign them with local government [[ward (politics)|ward]] boundaries and to reduce disparities in the sizes of constituency electorates, and the boundaries of the region changed, to align them with the boundaries of preserved counties.

The other four Dyfed constituencies are, again, [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consists of the constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]], Llanelli, [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

For Westminster purposes, the same new constituency boundaries will become effective for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 United Kingdom general election]].

==Voting==

In [[general election]]s for the National Assembly for Wales, each voter has two votes. The first vote may be used to vote for a candidate to become the Assembly Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system. The second vote may be used to vote for a regional [[closed list|closed party list]] of candidates. Additional member seats are allocated from the lists by the [[d'Hondt method]], with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation.

'''Ceredigion''' is a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. It elects one [[Assembly Member (Welsh Assembly)|Assembly Member]] by the [[first past the post]] method of election. It is also one of eight constituencies in the [[Mid_and_West_Wales_(National_Assembly_for_Wales_electoral_region)|Mid and West Wales]] [[National_Assembly_for_Wales_constituencies_and_electoral_regions|electoral region]], which elects four [[additional member system|additional members]], in addition to eight constituency members, to produce a degree of [[proportional representation]] for the region as a whole.

== Boundaries ==
The area of the constituency is similar to that of the [[Ceredigion|county of Ceredigion]]. 
=== 1999 to 2007 ===
The constituency was created for the [[National_Assembly_for_Wales_election,_1999|first election to the Assembly]], in 1999, with the name and boundaries of the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion Westminster constituency]]. It is a [[Dyfed constituencies|Dyfed constituency]], one of five constituencies covering, and entirely within, the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Dyfed]]. 

The other four Dyfed constituencies are [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consisted of the eight constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Llanelli, [[Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Meirionnydd Nant Conwy]], [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

=== From 2007 ===
Boundaries changed for the [[National_Assembly_for_Wales_election,_2007|2007 Assembly election]]. Ceredigion remained one of five Dyfed constituencies and one of eight constituencies in the Mid and West Wales region. 
However, boundaries within Dyfed changed, to realign them with local government [[ward (politics)|ward]] boundaries and to reduce disparities in the sizes of constituency electorates, and the boundaries of the region changed, to align them with the boundaries of preserved counties.

The other four Dyfed constituencies are, again, [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consists of the constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]], Llanelli, [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

For Westminster purposes, the same new constituency boundaries will become effective for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 United Kingdom general election]].

==Voting==

In [[general election]]s for the National Assembly for Wales, each voter has two votes. The first vote may be used to vote for a candidate to become the Assembly Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system. The second vote may be used to vote for a regional [[closed list|closed party list]] of candidates. Additional member seats are allocated from the lists by the [[d'Hondt method]], with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation.

'''Ceredigion''' is a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. It elects one [[Assembly Member (Welsh Assembly)|Assembly Member]] by the [[first past the post]] method of election. It is also one of eight constituencies in the [[Mid_and_West_Wales_(National_Assembly_for_Wales_electoral_region)|Mid and West Wales]] [[National_Assembly_for_Wales_constituencies_and_electoral_regions|electoral region]], which elects four [[additional member system|additional members]], in addition to eight constituency members, to produce a degree of [[proportional representation]] for the region as a whole.

== Boundaries ==
The area of the constituency is similar to that of the [[Ceredigion|county of Ceredigion]]. 
=== [[National_Assembly_for_Wales_election,_1999|1999]] to [[National_Assembly_for_Wales_election,_2007|2007]] ===
The constituency was created for the [[National_Assembly_for_Wales_election,_1999|first election to the Assembly]], in 1999, with the name and boundaries of the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion Westminster constituency]]. It is a [[Dyfed constituencies|Dyfed constituency]], one of five constituencies covering, and entirely within, the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Dyfed]]. 

The other four Dyfed constituencies are [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consisted of the eight constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Llanelli, [[Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Meirionnydd Nant Conwy]], [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

=== From [[National_Assembly_for_Wales_election,_2007|2007]] ===
Boundaries changed for the [[National_Assembly_for_Wales_election,_2007|2007 Assembly election]]. Ceredigion remained one of five Dyfed constituencies and one of eight constituencies in the Mid and West Wales region. 
However, boundaries within Dyfed changed, to realign them with local government [[ward (politics)|ward]] boundaries and to reduce disparities in the sizes of constituency electorates, and the boundaries of the region changed, to align them with the boundaries of preserved counties.

The other four Dyfed constituencies are, again, [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consists of the constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]], Llanelli, [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

For Westminster purposes, the same new constituency boundaries will become effective for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 United Kingdom general election]].

The other four Dyfed constituencies are, again, [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]], [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]] and [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]]. They are all within the Mid and West Wales electoral region.

The region consists of the constituencies of [[Brecon and Radnorshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]], Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]], Llanelli, [[Montgomeryshire (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] and Preseli Pembrokeshire.

For Westminster purposes, the same new constituency boundaries will become effective for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 United Kingdom general election]].
